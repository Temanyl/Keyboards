# Splitmanyl

![Splitmanyl]()

This 36 Key handwired ortholinear ergo keyboard is strongly inspired by the [Scotto36](https://github.com/joe-scotto/scottokeebs/tree/main/Scotto36) and the [Scotto34](https://github.com/joe-scotto/scottokeebs/tree/main/Scotto34).

I wanted to have a split keyboard again and I wanted some rotary encoders as media controls.
